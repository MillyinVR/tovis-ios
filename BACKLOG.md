# Tovis iOS — open-work backlog

> Single source of truth for what's left to do on the native app. Created 2026-07-07
> by consolidating `HANDOFF.md`, `HANDOFF-PRO-CAMERA.md`, and `docs/PRO-WEB-PARITY.md`.
> The **client** app is feature-complete + on TestFlight; the **pro** side + AI camera
> are the active build track. Backend/DTO counterpart work lives in `tovis-app/docs/BACKLOG.md`.
> Evergreen reference stays put: `README.md` (setup + services map), `docs/PRO-BACKEND-CONTRACTS.md`
> (pro `/api/v1` contract index), `docs/calibration/README.md`, `scripts/contract/README.md`.
>
> `[ ]` open · `[~]` partial · **(device)** needs a real device (sim has no camera/APNs).

## 1. Live-verification pass (nothing below is a build — it exercises shipped code)
Start the stack (`docker start tovis-dev-postgres` → `cd ~/Dev/tovis-app && pnpm dev`), Xcode ⌘R (Debug → localhost), sign in `client@tovis.app`/`password123`.
- [ ] Client polish #1–#6 live-verify: add-ons total-duration + finalize · mobile booking + Places autocomplete · deposit-pay CTA (`tovis://` return) · rebook-confirm card · Looks video autoplay/loop/mute · Discover filter sheet + place-jump + pin cluster tap-to-zoom.
- [ ] **(device)** Stripe `tovis://` redirect: confirm `SFSafariViewController` auto-follows the bounce (else the "Return to the app" button) — the one item a compile can't confirm.
- [ ] **(device)** Push deep-link tap → opens the specific booking (sim has no APNs).
- [ ] Pro suite sim-verify: Phase S session flow end-to-end (consult→send→approve→before→service→finish→after→wrap-up→mark-paid→aftercare), header tabs, calendar block CRUD + pending Approve/Deny (needs a PENDING booking in range), client 8-tab chart. None sim-verified.
- [ ] Camera on-device tune pass — never run against a real camera. Tune `Tovis/CoachTuning.swift`; hardware-verify level sign, face-exposure point mapping `(x,y)→(y,1−x)`, onion-skin alignment, EXIF orientation in the web gallery, WB gains, card-scan flow.
- [ ] Supabase Realtime ws smoke test: does the `sb_publishable_…` key authenticate the Realtime websocket? (Falls back safely to poll/focus if not — see `tovis-app/docs/runbooks/live-sync.md`.)

## 2. Launch train (outshine step-9)
- [ ] **(Tori/Xcode)** Archive → Validate → Upload (+ version/build bump).
- [ ] Optional: D3 board viewer on iOS.
- [ ] Board-creation context parity (web PR tovis-app#511, personalization spec §7–8): board type chips + event date + skippable chip questions in the board create/save-to-board flow, and the "N days until …" countdown on a board. API is additive (`type`/`eventDate`/`answers` on POST/PATCH `/api/v1/boards*`; question sets in `tovis-app/lib/boards/context.ts` are the SSOT) — iOS keeps working untouched, boards it creates default to GENERAL, so parity is deferred, not blocking.
- [ ] Self-profile parity (web PR tovis-app#513, personalization spec §6.6): a "Get better matches" settings screen (hair type/length/color, skin type/concern, category-interest chips — all optional, tap-to-clear) backed by additive `GET/PATCH /api/v1/client/self-profile`, plus the board-creation "save these details to my profile" opt-in (`writeThroughSelfProfile: true` on POST `/api/v1/boards`). Chip questions/values in `tovis-app/lib/personalization/selfProfile.ts` are the SSOT. Server-side ranking effects (affinity decay, interests boost, per-category prior) apply to iOS clients automatically — parity is deferred, not blocking. Natural pairing: build together with the board-context parity item above.
- [ ] Board-feed "Recommended for this board" parity (web PR tovis-app §4.4, personalization spec §4.4): a ranked recommendations section on a board detail screen, backed by the additive owner-only `GET /api/v1/boards/{id}/feed` (returns the standard looks-feed DTO — same card model iOS already renders elsewhere; supports `?limit=&cursor=&seen=`). DEFERRED because iOS has no board detail screen yet (only `SaveToBoardSheet.swift`); it pairs with the "D3 board viewer on iOS" + board-context parity items above. The endpoint personalizes to the board's purpose/answers/saved-look taste server-side, so once a board viewer exists on iOS this is just wiring one more fetch — not blocking.

## 3. Pro-side build work
- [ ] **Workstream 2 — multiple co-equal BASE services per booking**: core backend invariant change; investigate every `baseCount===1` assumption and get sign-off before implementing.
- [ ] **B4 — NFC ColorChecker calibration** (`docs/calibration/README.md`): blocked on physical cards — measure each print batch's swatch values, key by NFC card-version id, wire CoreNFC (`CameraCalibration` module: WB/exposure lock + `CIColorMatrix`).
- [ ] Web-client media-consent toggle (closes B3b): backend live (#427 merged); only the web UI remains (this is a tovis-app task — mirrored in `tovis-app/docs/BACKLOG.md`).

## 4. Deferred web-parity polish
Source: `docs/PRO-WEB-PARITY.md` (all 5 pages parity-complete; these are the tail).
- [ ] Pro aftercare-detail screen.
- [ ] In-app Message deep-link from the clients list.
- [ ] Per-tab chart write forms + technical-record decryption.
- [ ] Looks/followers profile stat tiles.
- [ ] Orphaned `ProClientDetailView` — re-link or delete.
- [ ] Pro sub-screens: locations editor (create/edit/set-primary/publish), payment-settings/membership, offering CREATE/DELETE (only toggle/edit shipped).
- [ ] Calendar parity: working-hours shading, drag/resize + tap-to-create, `ManagementModal` (full pending/waitlist list), booking-override retry dialog, side-by-side overlap columns.
- [ ] Client card-on-file (needs the Stripe iOS SDK).

## 5. Web↔iOS parity epic (audit 2026-07-08)
Comprehensive screen-by-screen audit of both apps (findings + Tori's layout
decisions in tovis-app memory `HANDOFF-web-ios-parity`; master roadmap +
web-side workstreams in `tovis-app/docs/BACKLOG.md §9`). Goal: every page matches
across web + iOS (camera / IAP / NFC / SEO excepted); parity = level **up**.
§4 above (the old PRO-WEB-PARITY tail) folds into A4/A5 below — this §5 is the
superset (adds auth + the full client surface). One screen/PR per session.

**Accepted divergences (leave as-is):** camera / best-shots / frame-scrubber +
wrap-up AI photographer-review (iOS-only, correct); membership purchase stays
web-only (Apple IAP — iOS display-only is right); NFC card/short-code + claim
ACCEPTANCE stay web (iOS generates claim links, web accepts); public SEO
`/p` pro-vanity mirror stays web (iOS renders the native pro profile instead).
NOT accepted divergences (they're A2 build items): the public *client* profile
`/u/[handle]` + public boards are social surfaces (looks/stats/follow), not SEO.

- [ ] **A1 — native auth** (biggest structural gap; App-Store hygiene — an app
  with sign-in should offer native sign-up). Build: signup role chooser → client
  signup (name/ZIP-geocode/phone/SMS-consent/email/password/TOS + Turnstile) →
  pro 3-step signup (work → about → account) → phone verify (already exists) +
  email-verify half → forgot/reset password → pro onboarding readiness checklist
  → pro license/document verification. Endpoints exist on web
  (`/api/v1/auth/register`, `/password-reset/*`, `/email/verify`, verification-docs).
- [ ] **A2 — first-class client screens** (today folded into Me/Home/Notifications
  or absent): **Settings hub** (biggest — profile edit, public handle, discovery
  location, saved addresses, payment methods, notif prefs) · Activity feed ·
  Aftercare inbox · Priority Offers (claim) · standalone Openings feed · Referrals
  activity list · Boards detail + create + share/event-countdown (iOS shows
  read-only preview tiles today) · **public client profile `/u/[handle]` viewer**
  (looks / stats / follow; guest + client viewer modes — no native equivalent
  exists today) · Share-your-look publish flow.
- [ ] **A3 — client booking detail** rebuild `BookingDetailView` to web's tabbed IA
  (Overview / Consultation / Aftercare) + add the missing pieces: before/after
  compare, aftercare care-notes, product-recommendations checkout, review section
  (leave rating/photos), recommended-window rebook CTA, add-to-calendar.
- [ ] **A4 — full pro parity** (build all): Last Minute EDITOR (iOS is read-only —
  create openings + settings/tiers) · Waitlist outreach workspace · pro's private
  client view — `ProClientChartView` per-tab write forms + technical-record
  decryption + a **`view=public` toggle** (chart ↔ that client's public profile;
  web has it, iOS doesn't) · calendar reschedule/
  edit-service-items + "offer a time" modals · booking-detail money-trail
  inspector · manual reminders creator/list (distinct from cadence settings) ·
  referral-REWARD config (iOS has activity-only) · data-migration wizard (5
  screens) · consolidated media manager + fuller owner-menu edit · review
  "feature media in portfolio" toggle.
- [ ] **A5 — pro home → Calendar**: land on Calendar like web (iOS lands on the
  Overview home today); delete the never-instantiated `Tovis/ProOverviewView.swift`.
- [ ] **A6 — minor drift**: **Inbox role-awareness FIX** — `InboxView` always shows
  `thread.professional.displayName`, so a pro sees the wrong party's name; make it
  role-aware + add web's filter tabs (All/Bookings/Waitlists/Pros) + context
  eyebrows · Home `InviteFriendCard` + two-column · Notifications day-grouping +
  filter chips (All/Unread/Bookings/Payments/Social).
- Stale-code cleanup surfaced: `ProNewBookingView` header says "SALON only" but
  handles mobile; `AppFiles/{LoginView,SessionModel}.swift` are stubs (live auth
  is in `ContentView.swift`).

### Note on superseded docs
This backlog replaced `HANDOFF.md`, `HANDOFF-PRO-CAMERA.md`, and `docs/PRO-WEB-PARITY.md`
(their open items are captured above; the evergreen setup/gotchas moved into `README.md`;
history is in git).
