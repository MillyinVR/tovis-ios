# Tovis iOS — open-work backlog

> Single source of truth for what's left to do on the native app. Created 2026-07-07
> by consolidating `HANDOFF.md`, `HANDOFF-PRO-CAMERA.md`, and `docs/PRO-WEB-PARITY.md`.
> The **client** app is feature-complete + on TestFlight; the **pro** side + AI camera
> are the active build track. Backend/DTO counterpart work lives in `tovis-app/docs/BACKLOG.md`.
> Evergreen reference stays put: `README.md` (setup + services map), `docs/PRO-BACKEND-CONTRACTS.md`
> (pro `/api/v1` contract index), `docs/calibration/README.md`, `scripts/contract/README.md`.
>
> `[ ]` open · `[~]` partial · **(device)** needs a real device (sim has no camera/APNs).

## ⭐ Work order — priority sequence

**Master cross-repo sequence lives in `tovis-app/docs/BACKLOG.md` (⭐ Work order,
Tori 2026-07-08).** We work that tier order, not section number. Where the iOS items land:
- **Tier 1:** **A7** — email-verification completion (blocks email/password signup;
  detail in `tovis-app §15`).
- **Tier 3:** ~~§7 messaging **M3–M5**~~ ✅ DONE (#14–#17) · ~~§6 post-payment read-endpoint
  follow-up~~ ✅ DONE (#24). Tier 3 is clear on iOS.
- **Tier 4:** §5 **A1** residual (pro onboarding checklist + license/doc verification —
  the rest of A1 is SHIPPED, see the ⚠️ note on A1 below) · **A8** Google Sign-In
  (`tovis-app §15`) · §5 **A2** client screens · **A3** booking detail · **A4/A5** pro parity.
- **Tier 7/8:** §1 live-verification · §2 launch train (**App Store upload**) · §3–§4
  deferred pro polish · camera polish (`tovis-app §17`) · **A9** TikTok (parked, `tovis-app §15`).

### ✅ Recently shipped (iOS, through 2026-07-09)
- **§6 PF5 — booking-detail payment-confirm surfaces (#24)** — consumes the new
  `checkoutStatus` + `rebookOfBookingId` read fields (web #550): pro `ProBookingDetailView`
  Payment card gains "Confirm payment received" (AWAITING_CONFIRMATION → confirm-payment route,
  auto-approves the coupled next booking); client `BookingDetailView` shows a "Pending — your pro
  will confirm" notice on a coupled aftercare PENDING rebook. Clears all §6 deferred niceties.
- **§7 messaging M3–M5 — inbox/thread refinement (#14–#17)** — filter tabs + context eyebrows
  (#14), "load earlier" paging (#15), image attachment composer (#16), thread deep-link +
  pro→client entry points (#17). The §7 epic is complete on iOS.
- **A7 — in-app email-verification completion screen (#18)** — resend + status re-check
  advancing to `.signedIn` (pairs web #546). Clears the Tier-1 email/password dead-end.
- **§12 NC4 — in-app notification-string parity (#19)** — server-fed strings mirror web copy;
  fixed the stale "Push — Coming soon" preferences label.
- **§12 NC5 — push deep-link routing + cross-shell switch (#20)** — `URLComponents` parse
  (`?step=`/`#review` survive), full Target→href map, role-aware client↔pro workspace switch;
  both `MainTabView` + `ProMainTabView` route symmetrically. **Tap path still device-verify only**
  (no APNs on sim — see §1 device checklist).
- **§12 NC5 residual — per-screen step-jump (#22)** — destinations now open scrolled to the
  deep-linked section instead of at the top: `ProReviewsListView` → the tapped review (parser
  now lifts the id from the `/pro/reviews#review-{id}` fragment, which was being dropped),
  `BookingDetailView` → consult / aftercare (Photos & sharing), `ProBookingDetailView` →
  aftercare. Reuses the `ThreadView` proxy-into-loader scroll pattern; one-shot per load. Tap
  path stays device-verify only.
- **A1 residual — native license/document verification screen (#9)** — shrinks A1 to the pro
  onboarding-readiness checklist (see the A1 note below).

---

## 1. Live-verification pass (nothing below is a build — it exercises shipped code)
Start the stack (`docker start tovis-dev-postgres` → `cd ~/Dev/tovis-app && pnpm dev`), Xcode ⌘R (Debug → localhost), sign in `client@tovis.app`/`password123`.
- [ ] Client polish #1–#6 live-verify: add-ons total-duration + finalize · mobile booking + Places autocomplete · deposit-pay CTA (`tovis://` return) · rebook-confirm card · Looks video autoplay/loop/mute · Discover filter sheet + place-jump + pin cluster tap-to-zoom.
- [ ] **(device)** Stripe `tovis://` redirect: confirm `SFSafariViewController` auto-follows the bounce (else the "Return to the app" button) — the one item a compile can't confirm.
- [ ] **(device)** Push deep-link tap → opens the specific booking (sim has no APNs).
- [ ] Pro suite sim-verify: Phase S session flow end-to-end (consult→send→approve→before→service→finish→after→wrap-up→mark-paid→aftercare), header tabs, calendar block CRUD + pending Approve/Deny (needs a PENDING booking in range), client 8-tab chart. None sim-verified.
- [ ] Camera on-device tune pass — never run against a real camera. Tune `Tovis/CoachTuning.swift`; hardware-verify level sign, face-exposure point mapping `(x,y)→(y,1−x)`, onion-skin alignment, EXIF orientation in the web gallery, WB gains, card-scan flow.
- [ ] Supabase Realtime ws smoke test: does the `sb_publishable_…` key authenticate the Realtime websocket? (Falls back safely to poll/focus if not — see `tovis-app/docs/runbooks/live-sync.md`.)

## 2. Launch train (outshine step-9)
- [ ] **(Tori/Xcode)** Archive → Validate → Upload (+ version/build bump).
- [ ] Optional: D3 board viewer on iOS.
- [ ] Board-creation context parity (web PR tovis-app#511, personalization spec §7–8): board type chips + event date + skippable chip questions in the board create/save-to-board flow, and the "N days until …" countdown on a board. API is additive (`type`/`eventDate`/`answers` on POST/PATCH `/api/v1/boards*`; question sets in `tovis-app/lib/boards/context.ts` are the SSOT) — iOS keeps working untouched, boards it creates default to GENERAL, so parity is deferred, not blocking.
- [ ] Self-profile parity (web PR tovis-app#513, personalization spec §6.6): a "Get better matches" settings screen (hair type/length/color, skin type/concern, category-interest chips — all optional, tap-to-clear) backed by additive `GET/PATCH /api/v1/client/self-profile`, plus the board-creation "save these details to my profile" opt-in (`writeThroughSelfProfile: true` on POST `/api/v1/boards`). Chip questions/values in `tovis-app/lib/personalization/selfProfile.ts` are the SSOT. Server-side ranking effects (affinity decay, interests boost, per-category prior) apply to iOS clients automatically — parity is deferred, not blocking. Natural pairing: build together with the board-context parity item above.
- [ ] Board-feed "Recommended for this board" parity (web PR tovis-app §4.4, personalization spec §4.4): a ranked recommendations section on a board detail screen, backed by the additive owner-only `GET /api/v1/boards/{id}/feed` (returns the standard looks-feed DTO — same card model iOS already renders elsewhere; supports `?limit=&cursor=&seen=`). DEFERRED because iOS has no board detail screen yet (only `SaveToBoardSheet.swift`); it pairs with the "D3 board viewer on iOS" + board-context parity items above. The endpoint personalizes to the board's purpose/answers/saved-look taste server-side, so once a board viewer exists on iOS this is just wiring one more fetch — not blocking.
- [ ] Source-tagged view impressions parity (web PR tovis-app §5.6, personalization spec §5.6): tag `recordViews` with where the view happened. iOS currently posts `POST /api/v1/looks/views` as the legacy `{ lookPostIds: [...] }` shape (`LooksView.swift` → `LooksClient.recordViews`), which the server reads as **FEED**-sourced — so iOS feed impressions are already correctly attributed and **nothing is broken**. Parity = switch to the source-tagged body `{ impressions: [{ lookPostId, source }] }` (source `"FEED"` / `"DETAIL"`; server enum `LookImpressionSource`, coerces unknown→FEED) and tag detail-screen opens as DETAIL if/when iOS records them. Small, additive, non-blocking — the windowed per-source aggregate that backs the anti-gaming velocity check is a server concern.

## 3. Pro-side build work
- [ ] **Workstream 2 — multiple co-equal BASE services per booking**: core backend invariant change; investigate every `baseCount===1` assumption and get sign-off before implementing.
- [ ] **B4 — NFC ColorChecker calibration** (`docs/calibration/README.md`): blocked on physical cards — measure each print batch's swatch values, key by NFC card-version id, wire CoreNFC (`CameraCalibration` module: WB/exposure lock + `CIColorMatrix`).
- [ ] Web-client media-consent toggle (closes B3b): backend live (#427 merged); only the web UI remains (this is a tovis-app task — mirrored in `tovis-app/docs/BACKLOG.md`).

## 4. Deferred web-parity polish
Source: `docs/PRO-WEB-PARITY.md` (all 5 pages parity-complete; these are the tail).
- [x] **A-AC1** Pro aftercare-detail screen — renders the before/after visual
  record (new shared `AftercareBeforeAfterPair`, also adopted by the aftercare
  list). Fed by the `media` pass-through on `GET .../aftercare` (tovis-app #554);
  screen stays text-only until that deploys. **SHIPPED (PR #27)**
- [x] **A-AC2** Aftercare featured-pair PICKER on the pro authoring screen —
  parity with web #561/#562 (tovis-app §24 AF3a). `ProAftercareAuthorView` loads
  the before/after candidates (existing `GET .../media`), shows Before/After grids
  with a "Feature" pill (image-only, one per phase, re-tap to clear), seeds from
  the saved pair, and sends the validated ids on save. New DTO fields
  (`featuredBefore/AfterAssetId` on the summary + save request) + pure
  `AftercareFeaturedPair` helper (partition + `resolveValidFeaturedId`, unit-
  tested). **Also fixes a cross-platform regression:** iOS previously omitted the
  featured ids, so any native aftercare save wiped a web-set pair (the server
  always writes them, coercing an absent field → null). No web/server change, no
  migration. **SHIPPED (PR #31)**
- [ ] In-app Message deep-link from the clients list.
- [ ] Per-tab chart write forms + technical-record decryption.
- [ ] Looks/followers profile stat tiles.
- [ ] Orphaned `ProClientDetailView` — re-link or delete.
- [ ] Pro sub-screens: locations editor (create/edit/set-primary/publish), payment-settings/membership, offering CREATE/DELETE (only toggle/edit shipped).
- [ ] Calendar parity: working-hours shading, drag/resize + tap-to-create, `ManagementModal` (full pending/waitlist list), booking-override retry dialog, side-by-side overlap columns.
- [ ] Client card-on-file (needs the Stripe iOS SDK).

## 5. Web↔iOS parity epic (audit 2026-07-08)
Comprehensive screen-by-screen audit of both apps (findings + Tori's layout
decisions in tovis-app memory `HANDOFF-web-ios-parity`; master roadmap +
web-side workstreams in `tovis-app/docs/BACKLOG.md §9`). Goal: every page matches
across web + iOS (camera / IAP / NFC / SEO excepted); parity = level **up**.
§4 above (the old PRO-WEB-PARITY tail) folds into A4/A5 below — this §5 is the
superset (adds auth + the full client surface). One screen/PR per session.

**Accepted divergences (leave as-is):** camera / best-shots / frame-scrubber +
wrap-up AI photographer-review (iOS-only, correct); membership purchase stays
web-only (Apple IAP — iOS display-only is right); NFC card/short-code + claim
ACCEPTANCE stay web (iOS generates claim links, web accepts); public SEO
`/p` pro-vanity mirror stays web (iOS renders the native pro profile instead).
NOT accepted divergences (they're A2 build items): the public *client* profile
`/u/[handle]` + public boards are social surfaces (looks/stats/follow), not SEO.

- [ ] **A1 — native auth.** ⚠️ **"Biggest structural gap" framing is STALE —
  reconciled by `tovis-app §15` (2026-07-08 audit):** native signup/login is largely
  SHIPPED (role chooser · client + pro 3-step signup on real `POST /auth/register` ·
  phone OTP · Sign in with Apple · forgot/reset · **App Attest landed** in lieu of
  Turnstile). **Remaining A1 = pro onboarding readiness checklist + pro license/document
  verification only.** The two real auth gaps are separate items: **A7** (email-verify
  completion — Tier 1) + **A8** (Google Sign-In — `tovis-app §15`). Original pre-build
  scope kept for reference: signup role chooser → client
  signup (name/ZIP-geocode/phone/SMS-consent/email/password/TOS + Turnstile) →
  pro 3-step signup (work → about → account) → phone verify (already exists) +
  email-verify half → forgot/reset password → pro onboarding readiness checklist
  → pro license/document verification. Endpoints exist on web
  (`/api/v1/auth/register`, `/password-reset/*`, `/email/verify`, verification-docs).
- [ ] **A2 — first-class client screens** (today folded into Me/Home/Notifications
  or absent): **Settings hub** (biggest — profile edit, public handle, discovery
  location, saved addresses, payment methods, notif prefs) · Activity feed ·
  Aftercare inbox · Priority Offers (claim) · standalone Openings feed · Referrals
  activity list · Boards detail + create + share/event-countdown (iOS shows
  read-only preview tiles today) · **public client profile `/u/[handle]` viewer**
  (looks / stats / follow; guest + client viewer modes — no native equivalent
  exists today) · Share-your-look publish flow.
- **A3 — client booking detail** — add web's aftercare pieces to `BookingDetailView`.
  Scoped 2026-07-09 (audit of web `app/client/(gated)/bookings/[id]/page.tsx` +
  `_data/loadClientBookingPage.ts` + each named component). **IA decision (Tori
  2026-07-09): keep the native single-scroll, state-gated layout — do NOT rebuild
  to web's top tabs** (native idiom; the view already surfaces consultation/
  aftercare/payment by state). Add the new pieces inline in the existing
  `aftercareCard` region. Increments (each backend-carrying one is a paired
  web+iOS PR — the `GET .../aftercare` `ClientAftercareDetailDTO` is iOS-only, so
  extending it is low-risk and touches no web render):
  - [x] **before/after compare** — already shipped (§24 AF3b / iOS #32,
    `AftercareBeforeAfterPair`).
  - [x] **aftercare care-notes** — already shipped (§24 AF3b, `careNotesCard`).
  - [x] **A3-cal add-to-calendar** — native `.ics` via `BookingCalendar` (TovisKit)
    + `ShareSheet`; upcoming, non-terminal bookings only. No backend. **iOS PR
    (this session).**
    - [x] **A3-cal-tz timezone-correct `.ics`** — follow-up to web PR #569.
      `BookingCalendar.icsDocument` now takes `timeZone: String?` and, for a valid
      IANA zone, emits a self-contained `VTIMEZONE` (DST-aware `TZOFFSET*` at the
      booked instant) + `DTSTART;TZID=<zone>:<localWallClock>` (no trailing `Z`);
      nil/invalid keeps the bare-UTC `…Z` fallback. Caller passes `booking.timeZone`.
      Mirrors web `lib/calendar/bookingInvite.ts`. No backend. **iOS PR (this session).**
  - [x] **A3-prod product-recommendations checkout** — ✅ shipped (web #567 `703bb6de`
    / iOS #35 `7ebd818`). Aftercare DTO grew `recommendedProducts` + `checkoutProducts`
    + editable gate; native −/+ picker + external-link rows + locked state.
  - [x] **A3-rebook recommended-window rebook CTA** — ✅ shipped (web #568 `90d64c10`
    / iOS #38 `2fcdf1a`). DTO grew `rebook{mode,window*,rebookedFor,declinedAt,nextBooking}`;
    native RECOMMENDED_WINDOW "Time to rebook" CTA + confirmed/pending next-appointment states.
  - [x] **A3-rev review section (leave rating/photos)** — ✅ shipped both parts.
    **4a** (rating + headline/body) — web #570 / iOS #40 `f16b034`: DTO grew
    `existingReview` text-slice + `reviewEligible`; native `ReviewsService`
    (create/edit/delete) + stars/text UI. **4b** (photos) — web #571 `f8f0456e` /
    iOS #41 `f942635`: DTO grew `existingReview.mediaAssets[]` (render URLs via
    `renderMediaUrlsBatch`); `ReviewsService` gained reviewMediaOptions /
    uploadReviewPhoto (reuses `SupabaseSignedUpload.put`) / attach / remove +
    create-time `attachedMediaIds`+`media` on submit; native Photos section =
    session-photo grid (create) + PhotosPicker upload-on-pick + attached grid w/
    remove (edit). Caps = 6 images + 1 video (server-enforced); fresh uploads are
    images-only on native, session videos still attachable by id.
  - ✅ **A3 COMPLETE 2026-07-10** — the whole §5 A3 client-booking-detail / payment-parity
    epic is done. Web #567/#568/#569/#570/#571 all merged, PENDING a prod deploy (held for Tori).
- [ ] **A4 — full pro parity** (build all): Last Minute EDITOR (iOS is read-only —
  create openings + settings/tiers) · Waitlist outreach workspace · pro's private
  client view — `ProClientChartView` per-tab write forms + technical-record
  decryption + a **`view=public` toggle** (chart ↔ that client's public profile;
  web has it, iOS doesn't) · calendar reschedule/
  edit-service-items + "offer a time" modals · booking-detail money-trail
  inspector · manual reminders creator/list (distinct from cadence settings) ·
  referral-REWARD config (iOS has activity-only) · data-migration wizard (5
  screens) · consolidated media manager + fuller owner-menu edit · review
  "feature media in portfolio" toggle.
  - [x] **A4-svc edit-service-items** — ✅ shipped 2026-07-10 (iOS #44 `ff06c47`,
    iOS-only — the web `PATCH /pro/bookings/{id}{serviceItems}` route + recompute +
    calendar `BookingModal` editor already existed). New `ProBookingService.editServiceItems`
    (minimal `serviceId+offeringId+sortOrder`; server re-derives price/dur/itemType; no
    `durationMinutes` → avoids `DURATION_MISMATCH`; idempotent) + `sellableServices(locationType:)`
    (`GET /pro/services`) + `ProSellableService`. `ProEditServiceItemsView` sheet (flat
    base-swappable picker = web's looser calendar editor, **not** the consultation single-BASE
    lock) off a new **Services card** in `ProBookingDetailView` (Edit shown while non-terminal,
    incl. IN_PROGRESS → the mid-session entry point). Rest of A4 (Last Minute editor, waitlist,
    private client-view writes + `view=public`, money-trail, manual reminders, referral-reward,
    data-migration wizard, media manager, portfolio-feature toggle) still open.
  - ↪ **Predecessor for mid-session service change** (`tovis-app §22`, MS-iOS): A4's
    **edit-service-items** modal is the first place iOS gains a TovisKit method to change
    services on an existing booking (today only `sendConsultationProposal` exists — no
    PATCH-with-serviceItems). Build A4 before/with §22-iOS so the client method isn't
    written twice. `ProConsultationFormView`'s single-BASE constraint (can't swap the base
    service) also needs a decision there — web is looser; keep both consistent.
- [ ] **A5 — pro home → Calendar**: land on Calendar like web (iOS lands on the
  Overview home today); delete the never-instantiated `Tovis/ProOverviewView.swift`.
- [ ] **A6 — minor drift**: ✅ **Inbox role-awareness FIX shipped** (PR #11, see §7) — rows
  + thread title now show the correct counterparty via the new `isViewerPro`. Still open:
  web's inbox filter tabs (All/Bookings/Waitlists/Pros) + context eyebrows (→ §7 increment 4) ·
  Home `InviteFriendCard` + two-column · Notifications day-grouping + filter chips
  (All/Unread/Bookings/Payments/Social).
- Stale-code cleanup surfaced: `ProNewBookingView` header says "SALON only" but
  handles mobile; `AppFiles/{LoginView,SessionModel}.swift` are stubs (live auth
  is in `ContentView.swift`).

## 6. Post-appointment payment confirmation + aftercare rebooking (audit 2026-07-08)
Backend + web build tracked in `tovis-app/docs/BACKLOG.md §10` (locked decisions there).
For off-platform / unverifiable payment methods (Venmo / Zelle / Cash / Apple Cash /
PayPal) the current appointment's checkout enters a new `AWAITING_CONFIRMATION` state
(client attests, pro confirms receipt to close it out); the client can still book the next
appointment immediately, and for **aftercare-sourced** next appointments approval is
**coupled to payment confirmation** (stays `PENDING` until the pro approves the payment,
which auto-`ACCEPTED`s it). Backend is additive — iOS keeps working until this ships.
- [x] **PF4 — iOS parity** — SHIPPED (PR #10, merged 2026-07-08). Client checkout shows the
  "Payment sent — waiting on your pro" banner (AWAITING_CONFIRMATION); pro session wrap-up
  gains "Confirm payment received" → `POST /pro/bookings/{id}/checkout/confirm-payment`
  (auto-approves the coupled next booking); PAYMENT_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED notif labelled.
  Followed the repo's stringly-typed checkout-status/event-key convention (no new enum).
- [x] **PF5 — booking-detail surfaces (read-endpoint follow-up)** — SHIPPED (PR #24, pairs web
  #550). The web PR exposed `checkoutStatus` + `rebookOfBookingId` on `GET /pro/bookings/[id]` +
  the client bookings read; iOS now consumes them: the pro booking-DETAIL Payment card shows
  "Confirm payment received" when AWAITING_CONFIRMATION (same confirm-payment route as the wrap-up,
  auto-approves the coupled next booking), and a coupled aftercare PENDING next appointment shows a
  "Pending — your pro will confirm" notice on `BookingDetailView`. Both fields decode optionally
  (dark until the web prod deploy of #550 lands — held for Tori). Clears all §6 deferred niceties.
- [x] **PF6 — rebook affordance + truthful copy at AWAITING_CONFIRMATION (iOS)** — SHIPPED
  (audit 2026-07-10; pairs web §10 PF6). On `BookingDetailView` the "waiting on your pro" banner
  and the rebook-window card already share one scroll, but the card was suppressed: `hasContent`
  (`ClientAftercareDetail`) counted only notes/photos/products, so a rebook-only summary
  (recommended window, no other content) hid the whole aftercare card + its "Rebook now" CTA.
  Fix: (1) new `ClientAftercareRebook.hasRenderableRebook` (recommended window OR active coupled
  next booking) folded into `hasContent`, and reused as the rebook-card render gate; (2) the
  `AWAITING_CONFIRMATION` banner copy is now conditional (`hasRebookOption`) so it points at
  rebooking instead of claiming "nothing else to do". Decode-only model change; DecodingTests
  cover the rebook-only `hasContent`.

## 7. Messaging refinement epic (2026-07-08)
Refine the Inbox/messaging surface for BOTH roles, web + iOS in parity. Root cause of the
"feels off" was a real bug: iOS showed the wrong counterparty (a pro saw their own name)
because the thread list DTO omitted participant user ids. Web + backend counterpart:
`tovis-app/docs/BACKLOG.md` messaging epic. 5 planned increments, one PR-pair each:
- [x] **M1 — role-aware counterparty + thread polish** — SHIPPED (web `tovis-app #531` +
  iOS PR #11). Backend added `isViewerPro` (thread list) + `counterpartyLastReadAt`
  (thread detail); iOS decodes `isViewerPro` → `MessageThread.counterpartyName/AvatarUrl`
  (rows + thread title + neutral empty-state); read receipts ("Read"), Today/Yesterday/date
  separators, optimistic send + "Failed · Retry". Web extracted a shared counterparty helper.
- [x] **M2 — realtime on the messages screens** — ALREADY DONE on iOS (no PR needed). The
  app-global `user:{id}` Realtime subscriber (commit `5033dc0`, `ContentView.startRealtime`)
  bumps `refreshTick` on any `changed` broadcast, and both `InboxView` and `ThreadView` observe
  it — so realtime already reaches the messages screens. The 30s inbox / 15s thread polls remain
  as a fail-open safety net. The real M2 gap was on web (shipped `tovis-app #533`).
- [x] **M3 — inbox filters + context eyebrows** — SHIPPED (PR #14). The 4 filter tabs
  (All/Bookings/Waitlists/Pros, server `?filter=`) + per-row context eyebrow (server-computed
  `eyebrow`/`isAccentContext`). Cleared the A6 inbox-filter item.
- [x] **M4a — "load earlier" history paging** — SHIPPED (PR #15). `ThreadView` pages backward
  via the server cursor (`nextCursor`/`hasMore`), preserving scroll position.
- [x] **M4b — image attachment composer** — SHIPPED (PR #16). `PhotosPicker` stage → upload →
  send; optimistic row + retry.
- [x] **M4c/M4d — thread deep-link + pro→client entry points** — SHIPPED (PR #17). A tapped
  new-message push opens the specific thread (`/messages/thread/{id}` → sheet in both shells);
  "Message" action wired via `resolveThread(clientId:)` from `ProBookingDetailView` /
  `ProClientChartView`. (Together #14–#17 cover the originally-scoped M3/M4/M5 items; the §7
  epic is complete on iOS.)

### Note on superseded docs
This backlog replaced `HANDOFF.md`, `HANDOFF-PRO-CAMERA.md`, and `docs/PRO-WEB-PARITY.md`
(their open items are captured above; the evergreen setup/gotchas moved into `README.md`;
history is in git).
